# Black Ninja Trials
Black Ninja is a training ground game for the black ninja clan. 

## Concept:
To prove your abilities by completing multiple trials consisting of Enemy Ninja, traps and puzzles. 
Complete each stage by reaching next gateway (check point); If discovered the gateway will lock until all enemy are eliminated, so be stealthy, or go on a killing spree.

### Rules:
<em>Reaching a check point:</em>
* Undetected (AI haven’t seen or heard the player);
* All AI enemies are dead.

<em>Alternatively</em>
* Unlock the secret door (look for clues).

### Enemy can be eliminated using:
* Environment (Falling, movable objects, gas – yet to be determined);
* Traps; or
* Ninja stars.

### Other details
* A player can be discovered by site;
* Noise will attract Enemy;
* Explosions will Alert enemy;
* Environmental kills will NOT Alert enemy;
* Checkpoints are saved when you enter a new area;
* When dying, you will re-spawn at checkpoint;
* You have a limited number of lives; and
* You are scored on how many areas you survive, 
  bonus points for not killing enemy’s, 
  or killing by stealth.

## Initial Requirements
1. Animated character model
    With custom animations for (this maybe beyond my abilities)
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•  Hiding behind a wall;
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Throwing items;
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Peeking corners. 
    
2. Static meshes for ninja stars
3. Static meshes for Supply boxes
4. Static meshes for Traps
5. Landscape tools
6. Sounds effects and music

### Future Improvements
* Achievement system
* co-op play
* Procedural generation of testing grounds 
  (I don’t think this is achievable but happy to be proven wrong)

## Summary
I will be attempting to develop this game as part of the tutorial. Looking at the end results of others I think I may have taken on too much. It’s early days in the process so lets see what I end up with. At the end it will be interesting to see how close to my Concept I reach.

I have (recently) purchased the “Unreal Multiplayer Mastery” course and am struggling to ignore it until I have this course completed.
